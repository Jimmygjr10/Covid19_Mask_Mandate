# COVID Mandated County Analysis

## Team: Red Zone

**Members:** Jimmy Greer, Ben Altshur, TeKisha Sampson &amp; Jason Goddard


**Objective:** Did Counties with COVID-19 mandates see fewer deaths than those without?  The analysis will be a function of the deaths as a percentage of the population.  

## ***Data Sets***
*co-est2020.csv:*   a dataset of population in 2020 by county in the United States <br>
*us-counties.csv:*  a dataset of the cumulative daily 2020 deaths by county taken on the last day of the year <br>
*county_mask_mandate_data.csv:*   a dataset on mask mandates in counties in the United States defined by whether a mask mandate was implemented

## ***EDA***
Pandas used to clean both sets


### Machine Learning
We will cluster counties based on Mandate, infections, and deaths using K-means in an effort to see how communties fared across the state.
