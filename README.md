# Real-Estate-Predicition

## Team: Red Zone
### Members: Jimmy Greer, Ben Altshur, TeKisha Sampson &amp; Jason Goddard
### Analysis Project: Real Estate Projections
### Objective: Out of a sample of cities, will the property value go up or down?
## ***Data Sets***
- Redfin home values 2017-2018
- Kaggle cost of living index 2017-2018

Real estate values are historically volatile, and we’d like to identify indicators that may be able
to predict shifts and hopefully add some stability to a predictive/investment model. We’d like
this model to be a tool that can be used on many different datasets, and have therefore chosen
pre-pandemic data as we believe that this will better suit the model for the future.
## ***EDA***
- Our Redfin data is robust and well laid out. However, there is a fair amount of data that
can be culled.
- For the Kaggle COL, our data is in two separate tables separated by year and includes
data from other countries that we’re not interested in. This will require a fair amount of
clean-up.
### Machine Learning
We will be using the JIMMY GREER method to cluster our data on “Restaurant” and TEKISHA
